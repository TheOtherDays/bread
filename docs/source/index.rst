``bread`` - Binary format parsing made easier
=============================================

Reading binary formats is a pain. ``bread`` (short for "binary read", but
pronounced like the baked good) makes that simpler. ``bread`` understands a
simple declarative specification of a binary format, which it uses to
parse. It's more verbose, but the format is a lot easier to understand and the
resulting object is a lot easier to use.
